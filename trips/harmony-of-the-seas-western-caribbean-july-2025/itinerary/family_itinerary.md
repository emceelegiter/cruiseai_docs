### **Day 1: Sat, Aug 30 - Embarkation in Galveston**

* **12:30 PM:** Arrive at the terminal, check in, and board the ship.
* **1:00 PM - 2:30 PM:** Lunch & Exploration. Head straight to the **Windjammer Marketplace** (Deck 16) for a buffet lunch before it gets too crowded. Alternatively, for a calmer start, visit **Park Café** (Deck 8).
* **2:30 PM - 3:30 PM:** Settle into your stateroom and unpack. The kids can check out the **Sports Court** (Deck 15) or the **Arcade** (Deck 15).
* **3:30 PM:** **Sail Away!** Find a spot on the pool deck or an upper deck to watch the ship depart from Galveston.
* **4:00 PM - 5:30 PM:** **Adventure Ocean Registration.** Head to the Youth Zone (Decks 14 & 15) to register the kids. This is crucial for the rest of the trip. The 6-year-old will be in the **Explorers** group (ages 6-8), a structured, camp-like experience. The 12-year-old will be in the **Teen Program** (ages 12-14), a less structured, more socially-oriented environment with freedom to come and go from dedicated teen spaces like The Living Room and Fuel Teen Disco.
* **6:00 PM:** Dinner at the **Main Dining Room**. Experience the classic cruise dining on your first night.
* **8:00 PM:** **Evening Show.** Attend the spectacular **"The Fine Line"** AquaTheater show (Deck 6). This immersive, 360-degree spectacle features world-class athletes performing mind-bending stunts, high-flying aerial feats, slacklining, and breathtaking high dives. It's a sensory feast with dramatic lighting, a powerful soundtrack, projections, and water effects. Highly recommended for the entire family, as its appeal lies in pure spectacle and raw "wow" factor, captivating all ages with its visual splendor and constant motion.
* **Other Entertainment Options:** Explore the ship's smaller-scale entertainment, including the Comedy Club (check for family-friendly shows), vibrant Royal Promenade Parades and Street Parties, or various live music venues like Boleros or the Schooner Bar.
* **9:30 PM:** Family walk through the illuminated **Central Park** (Deck 8) or along the **Boardwalk** (Deck 6) for a ride on the **Carousel**.

### **Day 2: Sun, Aug 31 - At Sea**

* **Morning (9:00 AM):** Family breakfast at **Park Café** (Deck 8). Quieter than the Windjammer with great bagels and sandwiches.
* **10:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** **Pool & Slide Time!**
  * **6-year-old:** The heart of their adventure will be **Splashaway Bay** (Deck 15), a vibrant aqua park with smaller waterslides (some 42-inch min. height), water cannons, and a multi-level jungle gym.
  * **12-year-old & Parents:** Conquer the trio of high-speed waterslides known as **The Perfect Storm** (Deck 15).
* **12:30 PM:** Lunch at the **Boardwalk Dog House** or grab a slice at **Sorrento's**.
* **Afternoon (2:00 PM - 4:30 PM):** Kids to **Adventure Ocean**. Parents can escape to the adults-only **Solarium** (Deck 15) for some quiet time in the whirlpools.
* **5:00 PM:** Family game of **Mini-Golf** (Deck 15).
* **6:30 PM:** Dinner at **Jamie's Italian** (Specialty Dining, Deck 8). A fun, family-friendly atmosphere with delicious pasta.
* **8:30 PM:** **Ice Skating Show!** Head to Studio B (Deck 4) for the incredible **"1887"** ice show. This original production is a magical, time-traveling love story inspired by Jules Verne, featuring professional ice skaters and cutting-edge projection mapping. It's a universally praised, family-friendly spectacle and an absolute must-see for all ages. Given its popularity, it should be one of the first shows you reserve.

### **Day 3: Mon, Sep 1 - At Sea**

* **Morning (9:30 AM):** **Insider Tip Breakfast.** Enjoy the complimentary, made-to-order breakfast at **Johnny Rockets** on the Boardwalk (Deck 6).
* **10:30 AM - 1:00 PM:** **Thrill Seeker Time.**
  * **12-year-old & a Parent:** Tackle the **FlowRider** surf simulator (Deck 16) (boogie boarding is more accessible) and the **Zip Line** (Deck 16) (check height/weight requirements).
  * **6-year-old & a Parent:** Conquer the **Rock Climbing Wall** (Deck 6), a genuine challenge for this age, and enjoy another visit to the Carousel.
* **1:00 PM:** Lunch at the **Windjammer**. Explore the vast buffet options.
* **Afternoon (2:30 PM - 5:00 PM):** Family time. Take on the **Ultimate Abyss** 10-story slide (Deck 16 to 6). The 6-year-old might be brave enough, but it's perfect for the 12-year-old.
* **6:30 PM:** Dinner at the **Main Dining Room**.
* **8:30 PM:** **Broadway at Sea!** See the full production of **"Grease"** in the Royal Theater (Deck 4/5). This high-energy, 90-minute musical features a live orchestra and iconic songs. It's an excellent choice for the 12-year-old, but parental discretion is advised for the 6-year-old due to mature themes. Consider a "divide and conquer" strategy for the evening.
* **10:00 PM:** Parents can enjoy live music at the **Boot & Bonnet Pub** (Deck 5) while the kids have their final hour at Adventure Ocean.

### **Day 4: Tue, Sep 2 - Perfect Day at CocoCay (7am - 5pm)**

* **Morning (8:00 AM):** Breakfast onboard, then head straight to the island to grab good lounge chairs at **Oasis Lagoon** (complimentary) or **Chill Island** (complimentary).
* **10:00 AM - 1:00 PM:** **Island Adventure.**
  * **Option A (Recommended):** Enjoy the extensive free amenities. Spend time at **Oasis Lagoon** (complimentary), let the 6-year-old play at **Splashaway Bay** (complimentary), and relax on **Chill Island**.
  * **Option B (For Thrill-Seekers):** If the 12-year-old is a dedicated thrill-seeker, consider purchasing a discounted **half-day pass for one parent and the 12-year-old** to **Thrill Waterpark** in the afternoon. This allows them to experience Daredevil's Peak and the wave pool.
* **1:00 PM:** Lunch at **Skipper's Grill** (complimentary BBQ).

### **Day 5: Wed, Sep 3 - Nassau, Bahamas (7am - 3pm)**

* **Note:** This is a very short port day. A pre-booked excursion is highly recommended.
* **8:00 AM:** Quick breakfast onboard and disembark early.
* **9:00 AM - 1:30 PM:** **Shore Excursion.**
  * **Recommended Family Option:** The **Blue Lagoon Island Dolphin Encounter and Beach Day**. This is the superior choice for your family, offering a unique and memorable animal interaction that both the 6-year-old and 12-year-old can experience together. It eliminates logistical stress and maximizes shared family memories, fitting perfectly within your short port window.
  * **Alternative:** While **Atlantis Aquaventure Waterpark** is an option, it would physically separate your family for much of the day due to height restrictions, and requires more complex logistics.
* **2:00 PM:** Back onboard the ship.
* **Afternoon:** Late lunch onboard. The kids can head to Adventure Ocean while parents relax.
* **6:30 PM:** Dinner at **Izumi Hibachi** (Specialty Dining, Deck 4). A fun, interactive dinner show the whole family will love. **Book this far in advance!**
* **8:30 PM:** Catch a comedy show at **The Attic** (check for family-friendly vs. adult-only showtimes) or live music at **Dazzles**.

---

### **Day 6: Thu, Sep 4 - At Sea**

* **Morning (9:30 AM):** A mix of activities. The 12-year-old might want to try the FlowRider again, while the 6-year-old enjoys a final visit to Splashaway Bay.
* **12:30 PM:** Lunch at **Solarium Bistro** (Deck 15). A calmer, healthier buffet option.
* **Afternoon (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM):** **Ice Skating!** Head to Studio B for one of the open ice-skating sessions for guests. This is a premier activity that bridges the age gap and should be prioritized as a family outing.
* **4:00 PM:** Parents enjoy a cocktail at the moving **Rising Tide Bar** as it ascends from the Promenade (Deck 5) to Central Park (Deck 8).
* **6:00 PM:** Pre-dinner family photos around the ship.
* **7:00 PM:** Farewell Dinner at the **Main Dining Room**.
* **9:00 PM:** **"Columbus, The Musical!"** in the Royal Theater. A fun, original production to cap off the cruise entertainment.

---

### **Day 7: Fri, Sep 5 - Puerto Costa Maya, Mexico (7am - 2pm)**

* **Note:** An even shorter port day. Time management is critical.
* **8:00 AM - 1:00 PM:** **Shore Excursion.**
  * **Top Recommendation (Relaxing):** A trip to **Mahahual beach** for a **Beach Break with Open Bar** (for adults). This offers flexibility, low cost, and a laid-back atmosphere, perfect for your shortest port day.
  * **Strong Second Choice (Active):** The **Lost Mayan Kingdom Water Park**. Its proximity to the port and suitability for both children's ages make it a logistically sound and fun-filled alternative.
  * **High Risk (Adventurous):** A **Chacchoben Mayan Ruins** tour is possible but will consume nearly the entire port time and carries a high risk of delays. **Only book this through the cruise line** to ensure they will wait for you if the tour is delayed.
* **1:30 PM:** Back onboard.
* **Afternoon:** Late lunch and pool time. The ship will be quieter as many are still ashore.
* **6:30 PM:** Dinner at **Sabor** (Specialty, Deck 6) for some delicious Mexican food.
* **8:30 PM:** Final AquaTheater Show or revisit a favorite bar/lounge.

### **Day 8: Sat, Sep 6 - At Sea**

* **Morning:** Last chance for favorite activities! One last ride on the waterslides, the Ultimate Abyss, or the Zip Line. Buy any last-minute souvenirs.
* **12:30 PM:** Final lunch. Try any of the complimentary spots you may have missed.
* **Afternoon:** Begin packing. Enjoy a final afternoon by the pool. The kids can have their last session at Adventure Ocean to say goodbye to new friends.
* **6:30 PM:** Final dinner. A great option is the **Main Dining Room** to say goodbye to your waitstaff.
* **Evening:** Pack your remaining luggage (leaving out essentials for the morning) to be placed outside your stateroom for collection.

---

### **Day 9: Sun, Sep 7 - Arrival in Galveston (7:00 AM)**

* **Morning:** Have one last breakfast onboard (Windjammer or Café Promenade). Listen for your disembarkation group to be called and proceed to the gangway. Welcome home!
