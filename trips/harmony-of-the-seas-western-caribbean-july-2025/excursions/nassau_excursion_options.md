### Family Recommendation

Given the short time in port and the ages of your children (6 and 12), here are the top recommendations:

1.  **Blue Lagoon Island Dolphin Encounter and Beach Day:** This is likely the best all-around option. It combines a relaxing beach day with a memorable and gentle animal interaction that both the 6-year-old and 12-year-old will love. The 5-hour duration fits well within your port time.
2.  **Resort Day Pass (Atlantis or Baha Bay):** If your family loves waterparks, this is a fantastic choice for high-energy fun. It will be a full, active day that caters perfectly to both kids' age levels.
