# Excursion Options: Puerto Costa Maya, Mexico

**Docking Time:** 7:00 AM - 2:00 PM

**CRITICAL WARNING:** Your time in Costa Maya is extremely limited (7 hours). The region's premier attraction, the Mayan Ruins, involves significant travel time. Any delay on an independent tour could cause you to miss the ship. For any major excursion, booking directly through the cruise line is the safest option as they guarantee your return to the ship.

### Excursion Categories

Here are the main types of excursions available, with notes on their suitability for a short port day.

#### 1. Mayan Ruins Exploration

*   **Description:** A guided tour to the magnificent **Chacchoben Mayan Ruins**, located approximately 50-60 minutes by bus from the port. You will explore ancient temples in a lush jungle setting.
*   **Best For:** Families interested in history and culture.
*   **Estimated Duration:** 4 - 5 hours.
*   **Recommendation:** This is a fantastic cultural experience, but it is a full-day commitment with a very tight schedule. **It is strongly recommended to book this excursion ONLY through Royal Caribbean.** This ensures that the ship will wait for your tour in case of any delays. An independent tour is too risky with this itinerary.

#### 2. All-Inclusive Beach Break

*   **Description:** Relax at a local beach club in the nearby village of Mahahual. These packages typically include reserved lounge chairs, an open bar for the adults, lunch, and access to the beautiful Caribbean beach.
*   **Best For:** Families seeking a relaxing, low-stress day with maximum beach time.
*   **Estimated Duration:** 3 - 5 hours (Flexible).
*   **Recommendation:** This is the safest and most relaxing option for your family given the short time in port. It guarantees a fun beach day without the worry of tight schedules.

#### 3. Local Adventures

*   **Description:** Shorter, more active excursions close to the port.
*   **Popular Options:** ATV jungle tours, guided snorkeling on the nearby Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, electric bike tours.
*   **Best For:** Travelers wanting an active experience without the time commitment of the ruins.
*   **Estimated Duration:** 2 - 4 hours.
*   **Recommendation:** These tours offer a great balance of activity and free time to explore the port village shops and restaurants.

#### 4. Bacalar Lagoon Tour (High Risk)

*   **Description:** A trip to the stunning "Lagoon of Seven Colors" for boat rides and swimming.
*   **Estimated Duration:** 6 - 6.5 hours.
*   **Recommendation:** **AVOID THIS EXCURSION.** The tour duration is far too long for a 7-hour port stay. The risk of missing the ship is extremely high.

### Family Recommendation

1.  **All-Inclusive Beach Break:** This is the top recommendation for your family. It's relaxing, fun for all ages, and eliminates any stress about returning to the ship on time.
2.  **Chacchoben Mayan Ruins (Cruise Line Excursion ONLY):** If your family has a strong interest in history, this is a worthwhile experience, but to mitigate the risk of delay, you should only book it directly with Royal Caribbean.
